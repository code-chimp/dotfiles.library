# Dotfiles Library

Scripting my dotfiles restoration because I was tired of issues with symlinks created by GNU Stow.

**NOTE:** These dotfiles assume a system has been set up with one of my ansible playbooks like [ansible.ubutnu](https://github.com/code-chimp/ansible.ubuntu) - also assumes you are "me"

## Example

```shell
./restore.sh
```
